    <!-- ===== INTRODUCTION ===== -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        When I first came across Machine Learning, my immediate curiosity was simple —
        how do these systems actually work? Without revising mathematics or formally
        studying machine learning algorithms, I jumped straight into building a project.
        In hindsight, this decision made me uncomfortable later, but it also became one
        of the most important learning experiences for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project, <em>“Machine Learning for Early Cardiac Risk”</em>, originated from
        a friend’s idea. He suggested collaborating so that we could complement each
        other’s strengths. He focused on understanding the problem domain, data, and
        medical context, while I took responsibility for the technical side — exploring
        machine learning models, implementation, and experimentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        This division of roles allowed us to move forward effectively, and more
        importantly, it pushed me to learn machine learning concepts through hands-on
        problem solving rather than theory alone.
    </p>

    <!-- ===== PROBLEM STATEMENT ===== -->
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <p>
        Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide, and
        many heart conditions develop gradually without clear symptoms in the early
        stages. Although patient clinical and lifestyle data are commonly available,
        extracting meaningful patterns from this data to assess early cardiac risk
        remains difficult using traditional methods.
    </p>

    <p>
        This limitation can delay timely medical intervention. Therefore, there is a
        need for a data-driven approach that can effectively analyze patient health
        indicators and support early identification of individuals who may be at risk
        of heart disease.
    </p>

    <!-- ===== TECHNICAL APPROACH ===== -->
    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

    <p>
        The primary challenge in this project was translating raw clinical and lifestyle
        data into a form suitable for machine learning models. Patient datasets often
        contain missing values, inconsistent scales, and features with varying levels
        of importance, making direct model training unreliable.
    </p>

    <p>
        To address this, the process began with careful data preprocessing. This
        included cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing
        consistent input features. These steps ensured that the model learned meaningful
        patterns rather than noise.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem was framed as a supervised classification task, where the objective
        was to distinguish between individuals at risk of heart disease and those
        without significant risk. Emphasis was placed on interpretability and evaluation
        to ensure that predictions were reliable and generalized across different data
        samples.
    </p>

    <!-- ===== METHODOLOGY ===== -->
    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>
        Like many beginners, I initially selected popular machine learning algorithms
        without fully understanding the dataset or the nature of the problem. A small
        dataset with around 100 rows and 10 features was used, and multiple algorithms
        were trained directly.
    </p>

    <p>
        The results initially appeared impressive, with accuracy and F1-scores exceeding
        95%. However, as I later learned through structured study via the CampusX
        machine learning lecture series, high accuracy alone does not guarantee a
        meaningful or reliable model.
    </p>

    <p>
        We then sourced a more realistic dataset from Kaggle containing over 10,000
        records and 22 clinical and lifestyle features. Before training, the dataset
        was analyzed for class imbalance, missing values, and feature relevance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Appropriate classification models were selected, including Logistic Regression,
        Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gaussian
        Naive Bayes. These models were evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score,
        accuracy, and confusion matrices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Later, an ensemble voting classifier was implemented by combining the
        top-performing models, leading to more stable and realistic performance.
    </p>

    <!-- ===== RESULTS ===== -->
    <h2>Results and Evaluation</h2>

    <p>
        Model evaluation focused on multiple metrics rather than accuracy alone.
        Precision measured the reliability of high-risk predictions, recall captured
        the ability to identify truly at-risk patients, and the F1-score balanced both.
    </p>

    <p>
        Individual models showed consistent performance, but no single model dominated
        across all metrics. The voting classifier achieved overall performance in the
        range of 87% to 90%, reflecting improved generalization compared to early naive
        experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The confusion matrix of the voting classifier provides insight into prediction
        behavior by explicitly highlighting false positives and false negatives.

    <!-- ===== FINAL THOUGHTS ===== -->
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
        This project began as an experiment driven by curiosity and gradually evolved
        into a structured exploration of machine learning for real-world healthcare
        applications. More than the final scores, the value of this work lies in the
        learning process — recognizing early mistakes, refining assumptions, and
        developing a disciplined evaluation mindset.
    </p>

    <p>
        The complete implementation, including the voting classifier, Streamlit-based
        application, and source code, is available in the GitHub repository. The Kaggle
        dataset used is also linked for transparency and reproducibility.
