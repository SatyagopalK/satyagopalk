    <p>
        When people talk about Artificial Intelligence, they define it in many ways —
        acting like humans, thinking like humans, or behaving rationally. When I first
        encountered these definitions, they felt important but distant. Yet one idea
        kept repeating itself: intelligence is about making the right decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I learned more, I realized that Machine Learning is one of the most practical
        ways to achieve this intelligence. Instead of writing every rule by hand, we
        show machines data and allow them to learn from it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like most students, I memorized definitions by Arthur Samuel and Tom Mitchell
        during my undergraduate days just to clear exams. It was only after working on
        small projects that something clicked — machine learning wasn’t really about
        definitions or formulas. It was about patterns.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Machine learning looks at data the way a child looks at pictures first — trying
        to understand the story before reading the words.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        To understand whether these patterns are meaningful, we evaluate them using
        metrics. With this perspective, those famous definitions finally started to
        make sense — not as exam answers, but as intuitive explanations.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Before discussing the types of machine learning, I’d like to acknowledge
        Aurélien Géron, whose work helped me understand how learning approaches are used
        in real-world systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most books and tutorials mention four major types — Supervised Learning,
        Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
        While these categories are important, it’s even more useful to understand how
        they differ in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Based on the Amount of Supervision Given</h2>

    <p>
        One simple way to classify machine learning systems is by looking at how much
        supervision is provided during training.
    </p>

    <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Think of solving a math problem in school. You are given the question and the
        correct answer. Your task is to figure out the steps connecting the two.
    </p>

    <p>
        Supervised learning works the same way. The algorithm is trained using labeled
        data — inputs paired with correct outputs. Once trained, the model can predict
        outcomes for unseen data.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Real-world examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email spam detection</li>
        <li>House price prediction</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Common algorithms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression</li>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Imagine being given a notebook full of questions but no answers. Your task is
        to observe patterns, group similar questions, and find structure on your own.
    </p>

    <p>
        In unsupervised learning, the algorithm receives unlabeled data and tries to
        discover hidden patterns or relationships.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Real-world examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer segmentation</li>
        <li>Clustering news articles by topic</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Common algorithms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>K-Means Clustering</li>
        <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Semi-Supervised Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Semi-supervised learning lies between supervised and unsupervised learning. A
        small portion of data is labeled, while the rest is unlabeled.
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach is especially useful when labeling data is expensive or
        time-consuming.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Real-world examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image classification with limited labeled data</li>
        <li>Speech recognition systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Reinforcement learning is learning through experience — like learning to ride
        a bicycle. You try, fail, adjust, and improve over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        An agent interacts with an environment and receives rewards or penalties. The
        goal is to maximize long-term rewards.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Real-world examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game-playing systems like AlphaGo</li>
        <li>Robots learning to walk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Batch and Online Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Machine learning systems can also be categorized based on how they learn from
        incoming data.
    </p>

    <h2>Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Instance-based learning relies on memorization and similarity, while
        model-based learning focuses on understanding underlying patterns and
        generalization.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Challenges of Machine Learning</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Choosing the right algorithm</li>
        <li>Insufficient data</li>
        <li>Non-representative datasets</li>
        <li>Poor data quality</li>
        <li>Irrelevant features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
        Machine learning is like teaching a child who knows nothing at first. Confusion
        is natural. What we’ve discussed here is just the beginning.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI and ML continue to evolve through the efforts of researchers and engineers
        worldwide — and that ongoing curiosity is what drives progress.
